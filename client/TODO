Todo:
  [X] figure out the correct way to send form def through the resource drawer
  [X] add material resource controls to the process formdef
  [] specify single vs many material controls
  [] look into adding filters for resource control, this would need to be able to be defined by a user
  [] combine like form definition fields, like ones that match up to interfaces, and use speard to include them in actual form definitions
  [] use more interfaces for form definitions and types (EX: Complexity wich would have min and max)

  [X] product form defs
  [X] shell in the product page
  [] order/quote/encounter(lead?) types
  [] price strategy for things, could be an base price plus options, aprice map, tiers
  [] create value-grid control, so that price map can be translated into a grid that tracks quantity and sums price. Create a helper function in resource control to take the info about the material and create the correct form
  [] add arbitrary form fieds to material and process
  [] control which fields are added to object-grid control, but require price (if its a price map only??)
  [] how possible is it to refactor what a formDefinition looks like, could fields be an object with form key being the key and the value would be the field definition (minus key?). This could improve typing abilities
